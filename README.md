Dear Professor Jarvis,

Hello! Here is my description of this Web Portfolio assignment. I struggled with the text float over images issue a lot. I've googled for answers and gets to fix the problems eventually. For instance, the signup banner at the bottom of my home page is a challenge for me, I wanted to make a dynamic panoramic look but it doesn't work that well in mobile view and tablet view, at least I was not satisfied. I have to add another bigger image in HTML to fix it. I know there is a much better solution somewhere, or it could be just a simple command that I forgot. In the end, I am okay with the result, but it's far from perfect.
